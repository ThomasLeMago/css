# CSS Sheets to make life easier

Downloadable sheets than can save you time when trying to design your website

# Bordered Divs

This sheet allows you to quickly create simple, but nice looking divs

    <div class="bordered-div">
        <p>Hello World!</p>
    </div>
    
    
The above creates a white border which can be changed with the classes:
- div-black
- div-yellow
- div-green
- div-blue

The div can be padded using the class **pad**

# Buttons

This sheet offers an easy way to make buttons look nice

    <button class="btn">Click Me!</button>
    
    
The above creates a responsive button. (be careful if you are using bootstrap, the class name is the same)

It's color can be changed using the following classes:
- btn-black
- btn-blue
- btn-coral

# Positions

This just allows to quickly pin elements to the corners of the screen

    <div class="stick-top-left">
        <p>Hello There!</p>
    </div>
    
One of four positions can be used:
- stick-bottom-left
- stick-top-left
- stick-top-right
- stick-bottom-left

# A final note

I know these are quite basic, i'm working towards making them more customisable and better looking, i'll try to add as many features as i can.
